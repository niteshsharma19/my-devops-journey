PROBLEM: Unable to Push to GitHub Using SSH

You were trying to push code from your local Git folder to GitHub using SSH but got this error:
    fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
Or push was failing in general due to SSH key setup or incorrect remote.

SOLUTION: Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create/Open Your Local Git Folder
    mkdir my-project
    cd my-project

2. Initialize Git
    git init

3. Connect GitHub Repo (SSH Way)
    git remote add origin git@github.com:niteshsharma19/my-devops-journey.git

4. Check the Remote is Set Correctly
    git remote -v

    You should see:
    origin  git@github.com:niteshsharma19/my-devops-journey.git (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:niteshsharma19/my-devops-journey.git (push)

5. Set or Fix the Remote if Wrong
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:niteshsharma19/my-devops-journey.git

6. Setup SSH Key (If Not Already Done)
    Check if key exists:
        ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    If not exists, create:
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"

7. Add SSH Key to GitHub
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    Copy the output. Go to:
    GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH Key > Paste and Save

8. Test the SSH Connection
    ssh -T git@github.com

    You should see:
    Hi niteshsharma19! You've successfully authenticated...

9. Stage and Commit Files
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

10. First-Time Push with Branch Link
    git push --set-upstream origin main

From Next Time, Simply Use:
    git push

SUMMARY:
git init                       - Starts Git in your folder
git remote add origin [URL]   - Connects to GitHub repo
ssh-keygen                    - Creates a key for authentication
ssh -T                        - Tests if SSH is working
git push --set-upstream       - Pushes code and links branch
